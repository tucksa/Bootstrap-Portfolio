                    <p class="lead sjt-p">Hello World! I am happy to have completed my first homework assignment for my coding Boot Camp. I had no prior experience in coding; however, after graduating with a degree in Anthropology, I got an unlikely job as a Project Manager in the telecomunications industry. This job has opened my eyes to the world of netowrking and computer science which lead to my curiosity of coding. I was not expecting to have my own website online in just the first couple of weeks. I have a long way to go and a lot to learn, but I am excited to have a few of the basics down already! 
                    <br>Although this website apears to have all of the bells and whistles, it is in fact missing a huge component to make it interactive- JavaScript. I am both excited and nervous about Jumping into Java next week. I am expecting it to be more difficult to learn and, for that reason, more exciting. The best things to have are the ones that do not come easy. This will be challeging, but will give me some real power in the virtual world. I will continue practicing the skills I have developed thus far to get one step closer to conquering the web. </p>
